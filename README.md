# training-data-python-scripts-for-tensorflow-object-detection-API

### EdjeElectronics scripts repository  [EdjeElectronics](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10) 
the repository contains the images, annotation data, .csv files, and TFRecords needed to train the detector. It also contains Python scripts that are used to generate the training data. It has scripts to test out the object detection classifier on images, videos, or a webcam feed (**NOTE**: here i'm just using object detection classifier on images).  I'm used it to generate my own training data. If you want to practice training your own electricity meter detector, you can leave all the files as they are. You can follow along with this tutorial to see how each of the files were generated, and then run the training. You will still need to generate the TFRecord files (train.record and test.record).

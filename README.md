# training-data-python-scripts-for-tensorflow-object-detection-API

### EdjeElectronics scripts repository  [EdjeElectronics](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10) 
the repository contains the images, annotation data, .csv files, and TFRecords needed to train the detector. It also contains Python scripts that are used to generate the training data. It has scripts to test out the object detection classifier on images, videos, or a webcam feed (**NOTE**: here i'm just using object detection classifier on images).  I'm used it to generate my own training data. If you want to practice training your own **electricity meter detector**, you can leave all the files as they are. 
**otherwise**, After clone my repo > follow this part (3. Gather and Label Pictures) from EdjeElectronics tutorial to train your own object detector.
